Description: This package is aimed at annotating and visualizing single-cell
    gene expression or chromatin accessibility profiles from secondary lymphoid 
    organs (SLO) using the tonsil atlas as reference. TODO second sentence saying
    a bit more. TODO third sentence to say even something more - required by 
    BiocCheck to have a "full sentence".
